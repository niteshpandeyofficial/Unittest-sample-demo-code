**unittest Example for Testing in Python**

This repository contains an example demonstrating how to use the unittest framework in Python. It includes the following:
- Usage of setUp(), tearDown(), and setUpClass() methods to set up and clean up state before and after tests.
- A simple example of a test case structure using unittest.TestCase.



Mentioned example demonstrates how to use Python's unittest framework to:
- Organize tests using classes that inherit from unittest.TestCase.
- Use the setUp() and tearDown() methods to manage state before and after each test.
- Use the setUpClass() method to set up class-level resources shared across tests.

Feel free to extend this example by adding more complex tests, exploring other unittest features, and modifying the test structure to suit your needs.
